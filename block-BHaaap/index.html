            <p>Before HTML 4 and CSS, very few HTML elements supported both border and padding, so the definition of the width and height of an element was not very contentious.</p>
            <p>However, it varied depending on the element.</p>
            <p>The HTML width attribute of a table defined the width of the table including its border.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the HTML width attribute of an image defined the width of the image itself (inside any border).</p>
            <p>The only element to support padding in those early days was the table cell. Width for the cell was defined as "the suggested width for a cell content in pixels excluding the cell padding.</p>
            <p>In 1996, CSS[8] introduced margin, border and padding for many more elements. </p>
            <p>It adopted a definition width in relation to content, border, margin and padding similar to that for a table cell.[9] This has since become known as the W3C box model.</p>
